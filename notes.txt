- we need delete buttons from database 
- control the size of conyainer wiyh the getters 
- we need to add way to pay in the app cass and use the method
- that id class stuff is for the buttons
today tommorrow this week 

This way, you will have a single event listener for the "payb" button, and when you click on a row, you'll navigate to the "pay.html" page with the selected name as a query parameter. On the "pay.html" page, you can then extract the name from the query parameter and display it as needed.
